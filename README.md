# Kinetics datasets

Kinetics is a collection of large-scale, high-quality datasets of URL links of up to 650,000 video clips that cover 400/600/700 human action classes, depending on the dataset version. The videos include human-object interactions such as playing instruments, as well as human-human interactions such as shaking hands and hugging. Each action class has at least 400/600/700 video clips. Each clip is human annotated with a single action class and lasts around 10 seconds.

For each dataset, the train/val/test splits are under different subfolders, e.g.:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/train/
https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/val/
https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/test/

The links/annotations for all datasets can be found under the annotations subfolders, e.g.
